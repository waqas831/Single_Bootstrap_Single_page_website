          his is the third item's accordion body. It is hidden by default, until
          the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style
          each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as
          the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this
          with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth
          noting that just about any HTML can go within the .accordion-body,
          though the transition does limit overflow.
